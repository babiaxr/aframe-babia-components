### babia-filter component

This component must be used with one of the `babia-query` components. This component will select a part of the data retrieved (by a key/filter) in order to represent just that part of the data. If the filter is not defined, it will retrieve all the data.
This component will put the data selected into the `babiaData` attribute of the entity.
